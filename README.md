# Grinder Grader

My dad loves the concept of "One Bite Pizza" and wants me to build a website for him to be able to rate sandwiches, so that's my goal.

## Overview

This project includes both a backend and a frontend component. The backend is built with Node.js, and the frontend is built with React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

   The backend server will start and listen on the specified port (usually `localhost:3003`).

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend application will start and open in your default web browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Configuration

- **Backend Configuration:** The backend server configuration (e.g., port number, database URL) can be adjusted in the `server.js` or `.env` file.
